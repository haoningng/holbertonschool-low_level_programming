# Project Tasks

0-preprocessor - runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file
1-compiler - compiles a C file but does not link and it it in an output file with extention .o
2-assembler - generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file with extension .s
3-name - compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun
4-puts.c - prints exactly ""Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line and should end with the value 0
5-printf.c - prints exacrly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line and should end with the value 0
6-size.c - prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on
100-intel - generates the assembly code (intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file with extention .s
101-quote.c - prints exactly "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19" followed by a new line
